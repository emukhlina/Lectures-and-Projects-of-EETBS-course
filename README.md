Throughout the "Energy and Environmental Technologies for Building Systems" course, I completed 9 lectures and successfully delivered 3 final projects. Here's a brief overview of these projects:

Project 1: Residential Load Factor (RLF) Method Implementation
- Implemented the Residential Load Factor (RLF) method for assessing energy consumption in residential buildings.
- Developed corresponding modules in Python for ease of use.

Project 2: HVAC Systems Air-Conditioning Processes Calculation Scripts
- Developed a set of scripts in Python for performing calculations of air-conditioning processes in heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems.

Project 3: Data-Driven Building Simulation for CO2 Emission Prediction
- Developed a data-driven building simulation approach for predicting CO2 emissions.
- Applied data splitting method with an 80-20-20 split and k-fold cross-validation using Python.
